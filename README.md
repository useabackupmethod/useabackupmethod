- 👋 Hi, I’m @useabackupmethod ... my name comes from all the humans I am forced to interact with day in and out. I literally wonder why their parents never used a backup method initially because I am not getting paid enough for the interaction. However, it also allows be to be thankful that I am not them and I am where I am so far in life.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... getting out of my current job, its' inhumane working conditions and majority of the patients that haunt the pharmacy phone lines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to code (obvi) and find something else to enjoy in life 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects and admire the knowledge of individuals who already know how to code
- 📫 How to reach me ... email or discord
